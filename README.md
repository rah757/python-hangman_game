### How to play:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/hangman-game.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   `cd hangman-game`

3. Run the game by executing the Python script:
   `python main.py`

*A random word will be chosen as the secret word. The goal is to guess this word letter by letter.*

*You can guess a letter by typing it and pressing Enter. If the letter is part of the word, it will be revealed; if not, you'll lose one of your limited incorrect guesses.*

*Keep guessing letters until you either uncover the entire word (win) or run out of incorrect guesses (lose).*

*The game will keep track of your wins and losses. Feel free to play as many rounds as you like and challenge yourself to improve your guessing skills!*
